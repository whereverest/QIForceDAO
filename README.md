## Working of Strategy:

This strategy allows the user to deposit their QI/MAI LP tokens, or if they just have single token QI or MAI lying in their wallet, the contract automatically swaps and converts that into required LP token so users can deposit instantly without any hassle.

Here's the simple overview:

## Harvesting

Due to Polygon's low transaction fees, we can harvest the rewards every few minutes. Due to this **the current APY is more than 300%!**

*Note: Mai's staking contract charges 0.5% on deposit, so it's advised for the user to not exit the pool instantly as they'll leave with less than what they deposited. Because of high APY this fees can be recovered in few days.*

## Deployment

The contract is deployed on Polygon Mainnet, you can interact with it via the UI hereðŸ‘‰ [https://apoorvlathey.com/projects/qi-farming/](https://apoorvlathey.com/projects/qi-farming/)

(Note: Use at your own risk, contract is not audited)
